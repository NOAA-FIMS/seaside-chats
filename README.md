# Seaside Chats

Coordination and documentation of seaside chats held under FIMS

## Background

What are [Seaside Chats](
https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/03/10/seaside-chats)? Seaside chats are
regular meetings to deliberately discuss data workflows, develop overlapping
skillsets, create shared systems for labs, and cultivate an open culture in the
research group. Learn more in [Lowndes et al. 2019: Supercharge your research](
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4). Look to Scott Large's
research group at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center for a great example of
[using GitHub to navigate the scheduling seaside chats](
https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/seaside/projects/2). The practice of using seaside
chats was largely brought to fisheries science through trainings provided by
[Openscapes.org](https://www.openscapes.org).

## Process

1. Watch this repository to be notified of future seaside chats.

1. Add ideas for future seaside chats as an issue in this repository.

1. Issues will be triaged by the current person in charge of organizing the
   seaside chats.

1. Once triaged, the topic will be assigned to a specific Thursday.

1. Watch your Google calendar, if you are subscribed to the FIMS calendar, for
   updates to the weekly topics.

1. If a topic is particularly helpful, highly discussed, or needs to be
   revisited, then notes will be added to the issue during or after the seaside
   chat such that they can be revisited at a later date.
